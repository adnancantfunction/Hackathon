## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancements made to integrate real-time weather data in Demo Mode and upgrade the Python AI algorithm.

## Changes Made

### 1. Demo Mode Enhancement (Frontend - App.jsx)
**Previous Behavior:**
- Used random/simulated weather values
- Simple calculations without real-time integration

**New Behavior:**
- âœ… **Now uses LIVE OpenWeatherMap API data**
- Real-time rainfall, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover
- Enhanced flood risk calculations with temperature and humidity factors
- AI reasoning now shows "Real-time", "LIVE", and "Current" indicators

**Key Updates:**
- Enhanced flood score calculation includes humidity >80% and temperature >35Â°C factors
- All AI reasoning messages now emphasize real-time data sources
- Wind speed information added to all decision reasoning
- Demo Mode now provides the same data quality as Python AI Mode

### 2. Python Backend AI Enhancement (backend/api.py)
**Previous Algorithm:**
- Basic feature mapping with simple normalization
- Static infrastructure values
- Limited weather integration

**New Enhanced Algorithm:**
- âœ¨ **Advanced feature engineering with non-linear scaling**
- ðŸŽ¯ **Power transformations** for critical features (rainfall intensity)
- ðŸ”¬ **Composite risk indicators:**
  - Rainfall intensity scaling
  - Saturation index (soil + humidity)
  - Drainage stress calculation
  - Climate severity score (temperature deviation + clouds + humidity)

**Enhanced Features:**
1. **Weather-Driven Features:**
   - MonsoonIntensity: Enhanced rainfall impact (1.5x multiplier, power=1.2)
   - TopographyDrainage: Drainage stress with 1.3x multiplier
   - DrainageSystems: Combined drainage + rainfall effects
   - ClimateChange: Composite climate indicator

2. **Soil & Water Systems:**
   - Siltation: Soil moisture + rainfall erosion factor
   - Watersheds: Multi-factor saturation index
   - WetlandLoss: Soil stress + drainage impact

3. **Coastal & Terrain:**
   - CoastalVulnerability: Humidity + clouds + rainfall composite
   - Landslides: Non-linear scaling (power=1.3) for extreme events

4. **Dynamic Infrastructure:**
   - RiverManagement: Increases with rainfall and drainage stress
   - DamsQuality: Decreases under rain stress
   - DeterioratingInfrastructure: Weather-stress responsive

5. **Environmental Factors:**
   - Deforestation: Temperature-dependent vegetation stress
   - Urbanization: Rainfall amplification in urban areas
   - Encroachments: Drainage-dependent risk

6. **Governance & Planning:**
   - IneffectiveDisasterPreparedness: Stress-tested by extreme rainfall
   - InadequatePlanning: Event-triggered adjustment

**Enhanced Reasoning Output:**
- Emoji indicators for better visualization
- Expanded feature list (now includes cloud cover)
- Clear model identification (XGBoost vs fallback)
- Enhanced console logging with feature breakdown

## Technical Improvements

### Algorithm Enhancements
```python
# Non-linear normalization function
def normalize(value, max_val=100, power=1.0):
    """Scale value from 0-max_val to 0-20 with optional power transformation"""
    normalized = (value / max_val) * 20
    if power != 1.0:
        normalized = (normalized / 20) ** power * 20
    return min(max(normalized, 0), 20)
```

### Composite Risk Factors
```python
saturation_index = (soil * 0.6 + humidity * 0.4) / 100
climate_severity = (
    (abs(temperature - 28) / 20) * 0.4 +
    (cloud_cover / 100) * 0.3 +
    (humidity / 100) * 0.3
) * 20
```
